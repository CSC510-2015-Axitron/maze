# Maze
Repo for Maze game

##Prerequisites
This is only functioning in Firefox currently.  Chrome requires a series of steps to run the beta version of the sotware that is pointlessly difficult.

##Usage
To run the current iteration of the game do the following:

- Clone the repo:
	
    `git clone https://github.com/CSC510-2015-Axitron/maze.git`

- Open index.html in Firefox in the main directory

- Alternatively open index.html in Firefox from the test directory to run current test framework
