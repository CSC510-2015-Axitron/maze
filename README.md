# Maze
Repo for Maze game

##Prerequisites 
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/CSC510-2015-Axitron/maze.svg?branch=autobuild)](https://travis-ci.org/CSC510-2015-Axitron/maze)
This is only functioning in Firefox currently.  Chrome requires a series of steps to run the beta version of the sotware that is pointlessly difficult.

##Usage
To run the current iteration of the game do the following:

- Clone the repo:
	
    `git clone https://github.com/CSC510-2015-Axitron/maze.git`

- Open index.html in Firefox in the main directory

- Alternatively open index.html in Firefox from the test directory to run current test framework.

- Use the arrow keys to move around the board.

- That's all it does right now!
