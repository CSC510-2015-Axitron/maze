# Maze [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/CSC510-2015-Axitron/maze.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/CSC510-2015-Axitron/maze)
Repo for Maze game

##Prerequisites
Due to a limitation in Chrome's origin policy handling of files, the project is most easily viewed in Firefox or Internet Explorer 11.

##Usage
To run the current iteration of the game (in IE11 or Firefox) do the following:

- Clone the repo:
	
    `git clone https://github.com/CSC510-2015-Axitron/maze.git`

- Open index.html in the main directory

- Alternatively open index.html from the test directory to run current test framework.

- Use the arrow keys to move around the board.

To run under Chrome:

- Perform the same cloning step into a web host directory (such as NCSU's www4 public html space)

- It will not run locally unless you completely disable same-origin-policy restrictions in Chrome, which applies to the entire browser, not per tab
